# COMP3010 Splunk Research

This contains a mixture of a log of my own development as well as experiments run to explore how to best utilise the tools



##### 30/12/2025

- Initial basic SPL queries were performed to see what kind of results are expected against what is received
- Interesting use of "spath" function to highlight missing entries due to how Splunk scans field values
- Utilised the "Add to Search" function to further investigate particular field/JSON object values
- Learned how to add specific fields to the "selected fields" section to best highlight distinct values to better spot any anomalies
- There is an overwhelming amount of data. It is up to me/the SOC team to define a scope that best displays anomalies
