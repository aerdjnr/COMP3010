# COMP3010 BOTSv3 Analysis



## Breakdown

This repository is broken down into three main sections:

* Analysis, where I will draw conclusions of specific events within the dataset, backed by first-hand evidence.
* Evidence, where all the proof which will be referenced in both research and analysis will be stored.
* Research, where I will provide a log of experiments using Search Processing Language (SPL) and (where applicable) tie it to analysis of the BOTSv3 dataset.
